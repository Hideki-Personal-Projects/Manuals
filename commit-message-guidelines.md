| `feat`      |Used when you add a new feature to the codebase. It‚Äôs user-facing and affects the product behavior.                                |
| `fix`       | Used when you fix a bug that causes incorrect behavior. It's usually something that was broken or didn‚Äôt work as expected.        |
| `docs`      | Used when you change documentation only. It does not affect code behavior.                                                        |
| `style`     | Used for code changes that don‚Äôt affect behavior or logic, but improve readability or styling.                                    |

| `chore`     | Used for non-code or non-feature tasks like config changes, dependency updates, tooling, etc.                                     |
| `perf`      | Used for changes that improve performance without altering features or logic.                                                     |
| `ci`        | Used for changes to Continuous Integration/Delivery (e.g., GitHub Actions, Travis, Jenkins).                                      |
| `build`     | Used for build-related changes like Webpack, Docker, Vite, Babel, etc.                                                            |
